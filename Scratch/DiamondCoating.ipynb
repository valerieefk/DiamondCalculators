    "1. Push load button\n",
    "1. Adjust the focus using page $\\uparrow \\downarrow$ to focus shadow line on right\n",
    "1. Next enter alignment edge\n",
    "    - click ruler on top right of selection screen and then click mark\n",
    "    - left click in center to add measure mark\n",
    "    - activate cross hair and left click on center to add alignement mark\n",
    "    - go to first alignment edge on top left of diamond and right click to set location\n",
    "    - then go to alignment section box and click edit and manualy enter x y coordinates\n",
    "    - repeat above for second location along top edge close to top right \n",
    "    - click show to make sure proper locations are set. repeat if wrong\n",
